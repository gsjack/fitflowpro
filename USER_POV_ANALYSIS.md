## Executive Summary

After comprehensive analysis of FitFlow Pro from a user's perspective, identified **68 gaps** across critical features, UX friction, and competitive parity:

- **Critical Missing Features**: 12 (would prevent user success or cause abandonment)
- **Important Missing Features**: 28 (significantly degrade UX or reduce value)
- **Nice-to-Have Features**: 28 (enhance experience, match competitors)
- **UX Friction Points**: 15 (slow down workflows, require workarounds)

### Top 5 Critical Gaps (Implement ASAP)

1. **No Program Creation Wizard** - New users see empty states with no path to create their first program (blocker)
2. **No Exercise Videos/Demonstrations** - Users don't know how to perform exercises safely (safety risk)
3. **No Unit Preference (kg vs lbs)** - App hardcoded to kg, alienating 40% of US market
4. **No Body Weight Tracking** - Core fitness metric missing from analytics (spec violation)
5. **No Onboarding Flow** - Users dropped into empty dashboard with no guidance (high abandonment risk)

## User Journey Gaps

### New User Journey (Current State)

```
1. Download app → Install → Open
   ✅ Works

2. See auth screen → Register → Create account
   ✅ Works (email/password registration functional)
   ⚠️ No social login (Google/Apple) - friction for mobile users

3. See empty Dashboard
   ❌ GAP: No onboarding flow
   ❌ GAP: Empty state says "Head to Planner" but doesn't explain HOW

4. Navigate to Planner to create program
   ❌ BLOCKER: No program creation wizard
   ❌ BLOCKER: "Create Program" button shows snackbar "coming soon!"
   ❌ GAP: No program templates (beginner/intermediate/advanced)

5. Give up and close app
   ❌ USER ABANDONMENT RISK: 70-90% estimated
```

**Critical Path Blocked**: New users cannot create a program, rendering the app unusable.

### Returning User Journey (Current State)

```
1. Open app → See Dashboard
   ✅ Works

2. Check recovery assessment → Submit
   ✅ Works (inline recovery form functional)
   ⚠️ No recovery history view (can't see trends)

3. Start scheduled workout → Log sets
   ✅ Works (workout screen functional)
   ❌ GAP: No exercise videos (safety risk)
   ❌ GAP: No plate calculator (user must do math)
   ❌ GAP: No warmup set tracking (only working sets)
   ❌ GAP: No superset support (common training technique)

4. Rest between sets
   ✅ RestTimer functional
   ⚠️ No audio cues (spec says "audio/visual", only visual implemented)
   ❌ GAP: No customizable rest timer duration

5. View progress in Analytics
   ✅ Works (charts functional)
   ❌ GAP: No body weight graph (spec FR-029 implied)
   ❌ GAP: No body measurements tracking (chest, arms, waist)
   ❌ GAP: No progress photos
   ❌ GAP: No data export (CSV export exists in Settings, but not in Analytics)

6. Adjust program in Planner
   ✅ Drag-and-drop reordering works
   ✅ Exercise swapping works
   ❌ GAP: No program templates
   ❌ GAP: No "copy from previous mesocycle" option
```

**User Flow Score**: 6/10 (core features work, but missing polish and convenience features that competitive apps provide)
