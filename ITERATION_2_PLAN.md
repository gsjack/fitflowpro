# Iteration 2 Plan

## Planning Date: October 4, 2025
## Planned Duration: 16-20 hours
## Iteration Goals: Make app bootable and complete P0 visual improvements

---

## Context from Iteration 1

### What Was Accomplished ‚úÖ
- WCAG AA text contrast compliance (92/100 score)
- 5 skeleton loading screen components created
- 15 haptic feedback events with Platform.OS checks
- Android emulator operational with 12 screenshots
- Web crash fixed (haptics protected)
- 250+ pages of comprehensive documentation

### What Was NOT Accomplished ‚ùå
- App navigation system (App.tsx is empty)
- Skeleton screen integration (components not wired)
- Typography size increases
- Touch target compliance
- Volume bar visibility
- Drag handle positioning
- Tab bar label visibility

### Critical Discovery üö®
**The app does not run at all** due to missing navigation infrastructure. This is a P0 blocker that must be resolved before any visual improvements can be verified or used.

## Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Make app bootable** - Success metric: App launches on iOS/Android simulator without crashes
2. **Complete P0 visual improvements** - Success metric: 8/8 P0 fixes verified with screenshots
3. **Verify all improvements visually** - Success metric: 12+ screenshots documenting all changes

## Features to Implement

### P0 - Critical (Must Have)

#### Feature 1: App Navigation System
**User Problem**: App.tsx is empty, no way to navigate between screens
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] React Navigation library installed (@react-navigation/native, @react-navigation/bottom-tabs)
- [ ] App.tsx implements bottom tab navigator
- [ ] All 7 screens connected: Auth, Dashboard, Workout, VO2max, Analytics, Planner, Settings
- [ ] Tab bar shows icons + labels ("Home", "Analytics", "Planner", "Settings")
- [ ] Auth flow properly gates access to authenticated screens
- [ ] App launches without crashes on iOS Simulator

**Effort Estimate**: L (4-6 hours)
**Assigned To**: Agent 1 (Navigation Specialist)
**Dependencies**: None

**Effort Estimate**: M (3-4 hours)
**Assigned To**: Agent 2 (Visual Polish Specialist)
**Dependencies**: Feature 1 (need navigation for tab bar)

#### Feature 3: Integrate Skeleton Loading Screens

## Technical Improvements

### 1. React Navigation Installation
**Why**: App.tsx is empty, no navigation system exists
**Impact**: Enables basic app usage, unblocks all screens
**Effort**: M (30 min install + 4 hours implementation)

### 2. Missing P0 Implementation
**Why**: Only 37.5% of P0 fixes were completed in Iteration 1
**Impact**: Brings accessibility and UX to production-ready state
**Effort**: M (3-4 hours)

### 3. Skeleton Integration
**Why**: Components exist but provide no value if not wired up
**Impact**: -62% perceived load time (800ms ‚Üí 300ms)
**Effort**: S (2-3 hours)

---

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Test app launch on iOS Simulator
- [ ] Test app launch on Android Emulator
- [ ] Test navigation between all 7 screens
- [ ] Test skeleton loading states
- [ ] Test WCAG contrast with Color Contrast Analyzer
- [ ] Test touch targets with iOS Accessibility Inspector
- [ ] Regression test: Ensure existing features still work

### Automated Testing
- [ ] Update visual regression baselines
- [ ] Add navigation flow tests
- [ ] Add skeleton loading state tests
- [ ] Run TypeScript compiler checks

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Measure app launch time (< 3s target)
- [ ] Measure screen transition time (< 300ms target)
- [ ] Measure skeleton display duration (200ms minimum)
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks during navigation

---

## Success Criteria

**Iteration is successful if**:
- [x] App launches without crashes on iOS Simulator ‚úÖ REQUIRED
- [x] All 7 screens accessible via navigation ‚úÖ REQUIRED
- [x] All 8 P0 visual fixes implemented and verified ‚úÖ REQUIRED
- [x] >= 12 screenshots captured documenting improvements ‚úÖ REQUIRED
- [ ] TypeScript errors < 10 (nice to have)
- [ ] Visual regression tests configured (nice to have)
- [ ] Physical device testing complete (optional)

**Production ready if**:
- [x] All success criteria met
- [x] WCAG AA compliance maintained (92/100)
- [x] No P0 bugs or blockers
- [x] Test pass rate >= 90%
- [x] Performance benchmarks met (launch < 3s, navigation < 300ms)

**Minimum viable outcome**: App boots, navigation works, 8/8 P0 fixes verified with screenshots

---

## Risk & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Navigation implementation breaks existing screens
**Impact**: HIGH
**Mitigation**: Test each screen individually after wiring navigation. Use git branches for easy rollback.

### Risk 2: TypeScript errors prevent compilation
**Impact**: HIGH
**Mitigation**: Focus on critical errors first. Use `// @ts-expect-error` with TODO comments for non-critical issues.

### Risk 3: Skeleton screens cause layout shifts
**Impact**: MEDIUM
**Mitigation**: Match skeleton dimensions exactly to real content. Use `minHeight` to reserve space.

### Risk 4: Screenshot capture fails again
**Impact**: MEDIUM
**Mitigation**: Use iOS Simulator instead of Expo Web (more reliable). Have Agent 4 test capture script early.

### Risk 5: Haptic feedback doesn't work on physical devices
**Impact**: LOW
**Mitigation**: Code is already implemented with Platform.OS checks. Physical testing is validation only.

## Deferred to Iteration 3

Features NOT in this iteration:

1. **Empty State Screens** - **Reason**: Not blocking user success, can be added post-launch
2. **Micro-animations** - **Reason**: Polish, not critical for MVP
3. **Form Ergonomics** (larger buttons, swipe gestures) - **Reason**: Current UX acceptable
4. **Recovery Assessment UX** (emoji labels) - **Reason**: Current form functional
5. **ESLint Warning Cleanup** (664 warnings) - **Reason**: Not blocking compilation
6. **Advanced Analytics Charts** - **Reason**: Basic charts exist and work
7. **Wearable Integration** - **Reason**: Future enhancement

---

## Notes

- **Focus on getting app bootable first** - This is the critical blocker
- **Navigation must work before visual improvements can be verified** - Order matters
- **Use iOS Simulator for screenshots** - More reliable than Expo Web
- **Test early and often** - Catch regressions immediately
- **Document everything** - Screenshots are evidence of success
- **Keep WCAG AA compliance** - Don't regress on accessibility
- **Parallel work where possible** - Agent 5 can work independently on TypeScript
