## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As an evidence-based lifter following Renaissance Periodization methodology, I want a mobile-first training application that guides me through scientifically validated hypertrophy and cardiovascular training programs, automatically adjusts my workouts based on my recovery status, and tracks my progress across strength, volume, and VO2max metrics, so I can optimize muscle growth and cardiovascular fitness without the guesswork of manual programming.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Complete a Guided Workout Session**
1. **Given** I am starting my Push A workout for week 2 of my mesocycle, **When** I open the workout session, **Then** I see the complete exercise list with prescribed sets, target rep ranges, and recommended RIR (Reps in Reserve)
2. **Given** I complete a set of bench press at 185lbs for 8 reps at RIR 2, **When** I log the set, **Then** the system records the weight, reps, and RIR, automatically starts the appropriate rest timer (3-5 minutes for compound movements), and displays my next set with auto-regulated load suggestions
3. **Given** my workout is interrupted after completing 3 of 8 exercises, **When** I close the app and reopen within 24 hours, **Then** I can resume exactly where I left off with all previous sets preserved

**Scenario 2: Auto-Regulation Based on Recovery**
1. **Given** it is Monday morning and I have a Push A workout scheduled, **When** I open the app, **Then** I am prompted with a 3-question recovery assessment (sleep quality, soreness level, stress)
2. **Given** I report poor sleep (4/10), high soreness (8/10), and high stress (7/10), **When** the system calculates my recovery score, **Then** my workout volume is automatically reduced by 20-30% (fewer sets or reduced intensity) with a notification explaining the adjustment
3. **Given** I consistently report good recovery scores, **When** the system detects I'm adapting well, **Then** my weekly volume trends toward MAV (Maximum Adaptive Volume) for each muscle group

**Scenario 3: Track and Analyze Progression**
1. **Given** I have completed 4 weeks of a mesocycle, **When** I view my analytics dashboard, **Then** I see graphs showing my 1RM progression for major lifts, total weekly tonnage trends, and VO2max improvements from cardio sessions
2. **Given** I am viewing my chest muscle group analytics, **When** I check the volume tracking chart, **Then** I see weekly comparisons of completed volume vs. planned volume vs. recommended ranges (MEV/MAV/MRV landmarks), with visual indicators showing if I'm under-training or approaching overreaching
3. **Given** I complete a mesocycle (typically 4-6 weeks), **When** the deload week arrives, **Then** the system automatically transitions to reduced volume programming and prompts me to begin the next accumulation phase

**Scenario 4: Plan and Customize Training Program**
1. **Given** I want to modify my Pull B workout, **When** I enter the drag-and-drop training planner, **Then** I can swap exercises (e.g., replace barbell rows with dumbbell rows), adjust set counts, and see real-time validation that my program meets minimum volume targets for each muscle group
2. **Given** I drag a lat pulldown exercise to replace pull-ups, **When** the system validates the change, **Then** it confirms that vertical pulling volume remains adequate and auto-adjusts set recommendations to maintain stimulus
3. **Given** I attempt to remove all horizontal pulling exercises from my Pull day, **When** the system validates the program, **Then** it warns me that rear delt and mid-back volume fall below MEV (Minimum Effective Volume) and suggests corrective changes

**Scenario 5: Execute VO2max Cardio Protocol**
1. **Given** it is Wednesday and I have a VO2max training session scheduled, **When** I start the workout, **Then** the app guides me through the Norwegian 4x4 protocol (4 minutes at 90-95% max HR, 3 minutes active recovery, repeat 4 times) with interval timers and target heart rate zones
2. **Given** I am in the second 4-minute work interval, **When** the timer counts down, **Then** I receive audio/visual cues at 1 minute remaining, 30 seconds, and 10 seconds, plus real-time feedback if my heart rate drifts outside the target zone
3. **Given** I complete the VO2max session and log my perceived exertion, **When** the data is saved, **Then** my VO2max trend line updates and the system calculates my cardiovascular fitness improvement over the mesocycle

### Edge Cases

**Workout Session Management**
- What happens when I complete 5 sets of an exercise but the program called for 3? System should log the extra sets and flag potential over-reaching for coach review
- What happens when I pause a workout for 25 hours (exceeding the 24-hour resume window)? System should archive the incomplete session as "abandoned" and prompt me to start a fresh session
- What happens when I log an injury during a set (e.g., shoulder strain on overhead press)? System should allow me to mark the exercise as "skipped due to injury," log the incident, and suggest alternative exercises for future sessions

**Recovery and Auto-Regulation**
- What happens when I skip the recovery assessment before a workout? System should use the most recent assessment within the past 72 hours or default to "moderate" recovery assumptions
- What happens when I report poor recovery for 5+ consecutive days? System should trigger a notification suggesting an unplanned deload week or rest day
- What happens when my recovery score contradicts my performance (poor recovery reported but hitting PRs)? System should learn from actual performance data and weight recovery scores accordingly over time

**Volume and Progression**
- What happens when I consistently fail to complete prescribed sets (e.g., stopping at set 2 of 4 due to fatigue)? System should detect the pattern and recommend reducing working weights or total volume
- What happens when I exceed MRV (Maximum Recoverable Volume) for a muscle group? System should display a warning and recommend redistributing volume or scheduling a deload
- What happens when I don't progress in weight or reps for 3+ consecutive weeks? System should flag the plateau and suggest technique review, deload, or exercise variation

**Data and Synchronization**
- What happens when I lose network connectivity mid-workout? All workout data must persist locally and sync automatically when connectivity resumes
- What happens when I try to start the same workout session on a second device while it's active on another? System must display a notification that the session is locked to the first device and offer to force-transfer the session (ending it on the original device)
- What happens when I delete a historical workout by accident? System must display a confirmation prompt before deletion; once confirmed, deletion is permanent with no recovery mechanism

**Periodization and Programming**
- What happens when I want to extend a mesocycle from 4 weeks to 6 weeks? System should allow manual extension with validation that volume progression remains sustainable
- What happens when I skip an entire week of training (vacation, illness)? System should offer to repeat the previous week, skip ahead, or restart the mesocycle
- What happens when I want to switch from a 6-day split to a 4-day split mid-mesocycle? System should allow the change but display a warning that periodization continuity may be disrupted, then recalculate volume targets and tracking based on the new program structure
