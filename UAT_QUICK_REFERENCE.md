4. **Alert dev team** if P0 found
5. **Respond to participant questions** (Slack, email)

**Red flags** (escalate immediately):
- Any P0 bug reported
- ≥ 3 participants report same issue (indicates common bug)
- Participant says "I would not use this app"

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What if a participant can't complete all scenarios?
**A**: That's okay! Even partial feedback is valuable. Ask them to complete at least Scenarios 1, 2, and 4 (onboarding, workout, analytics).

### Q: What if we find a P0 bug on Day 1?
**A**: Pause UAT, fix immediately, release new build, restart testing.

### Q: How do we handle duplicate bug reports?
**A**: Mark as "Duplicate" in bug tracker, reference original bug ID. Duplicates indicate high-impact issues.

### Q: What if user satisfaction is low but no P0 bugs?
**A**: Defer launch. Low satisfaction = users won't adopt. Identify top 3 pain points, fix, re-test.

### Q: Can we launch with P1 bugs?
**A**: Yes, if ≤ 3 P1 bugs AND they have workarounds AND they're documented. Prioritize fixes for v1.1.

### Q: What if accessibility fails?
**A**: Do NOT launch. Accessibility is not optional. Fix screen reader issues, re-test with accessibility users.
