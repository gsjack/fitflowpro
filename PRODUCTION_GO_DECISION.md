## Acceptable Trade-offs

**Missing Features** (v1.1 Roadmap):
- ⚠️ Forgot password flow (workaround: admin can reset)
- ⚠️ Onboarding tutorial (wizard provides initial guidance)

**Testing Gaps** (Acceptable):
- ⚠️ Physical device testing pending (simulator successful)
- ⚠️ No CI/CD automation (manual deployment documented)

**Code Quality** (Non-blocking):
- ⚠️ 141 TypeScript errors in test files (isolated, non-blocking)
- ⚠️ 664 ESLint warnings (code quality suggestions)

---

## Risk Assessment: LOW ✅

**High Risks**: ✅ ALL MITIGATED
- ✅ TypeScript errors (RESOLVED: 0 production errors)
- ✅ API bugs (RESOLVED: 3 bugs fixed)
- ✅ WCAG non-compliance (RESOLVED: 92% compliant)

**Medium Risks**: ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE WITH WORKAROUNDS
- Forgot password (admin reset available)
- Onboarding tutorial (wizard provides guidance)
- Physical device testing (simulator verified)
- No CI/CD (manual deployment ready)

**Low Risks**: ✅ MONITORED
- ESLint warnings (gradual cleanup)
- Skeleton screen integration (v1.1)
- Test coverage gaps (mobile integration tests)

---

## Deployment Timeline

**Immediate Deployment** (1 hour):
1. **Backend** (20 min): Build, migrate, restart PM2
2. **Mobile** (30 min): EAS build or Expo Go
3. **Nginx/SSL** (10 min): Configure reverse proxy + Let's Encrypt

**Post-Deployment** (Week 1):
1. **Day 1**: Soft launch with 10-15 beta testers
2. **Day 2-7**: Monitor logs, collect feedback
3. **Week 2-4**: Address production bugs

**v1.1 Planning** (1-3 months):
- Forgot password flow (8 hours)
- Onboarding tutorial (12 hours)
- CI/CD pipeline (16 hours)
- Mobile device testing matrix (8 hours)
