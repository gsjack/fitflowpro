## Conclusion

[2-3 paragraph summary of UAT outcomes, decision rationale, and next steps]

**Example**:
```
FitFlow Pro UAT was a resounding success. 8 out of 10 participants rated the app 4/5 or higher, with an average design rating of 4.2/5.0. Users praised the intuitive workout logging, motivating analytics, and comprehensive exercise library. The automatic rest timer and volume warnings were particularly well-received.

While 7 bugs were discovered during UAT, all 2 P0 bugs were fixed immediately and re-tested successfully. The 5 remaining P1 bugs have acceptable workarounds and are scheduled for the v1.1 release in Q4 2025. No accessibility blockers were found, with screen reader users rating the app 4.2/5.0.

Based on these results, we recommend LAUNCHING FitFlow Pro on October 20, 2025. Post-launch, we will prioritize fixing the deferred P1 bugs and implementing the top user-requested enhancements (improved exercise swap algorithm, recovery assessment notifications, and dark mode).
