- Login functionality (API level)

**Workout Management** (Phase 5-6):
- Fetch workout by date
- Create new workout session
- Mark workout in_progress
- Complete workout

**Set Logging** (Phase 5-6):
- Log weight, reps, RIR for each set

- Batch logging of 20+ sets

**Dashboard** (Phase 9):

### ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **Duplicate Login Button**:
   - **Issue**: Two "Login" buttons on auth screen (header + form)
   - **Impact**: Playwright tests fail due to ambiguity
   - **Severity**: Low (functional, just needs selector fix)
   - **Fix**: Add unique test ID or hide header login on auth screen

2. **Volume Data Loading**:
   - **Issue**: "Failed to load volume data" shown for new users
   - **Expected**: Should show "No workouts yet" or 0 volume
   - **Severity**: Low (cosmetic, data loads correctly after first workout)

## Dependencies Fixed

During test execution, discovered missing dependencies for web build:

1. **react-native-reanimated@~4.1.1**:
   - Required by: react-native-draggable-flatlist
