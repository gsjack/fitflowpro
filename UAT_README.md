## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How long does UAT take?
**A**: 2 weeks total. Week 1: Active testing (5-7 days). Week 2: Analysis and fixes (7 days).

### Q: How many participants do we need?
**A**: 5-10 participants. Target mix: 3 beginners, 3 intermediate, 2 advanced, 2 accessibility testers (screen reader users).

### Q: What if we find a P0 bug on Day 1?
**A**: Pause UAT immediately. Fix bug, release new build, notify participants of new build, restart testing.

### Q: Can we launch with P1 bugs?
**A**: Yes, if ≤ 3 P1 bugs AND all have documented workarounds AND are scheduled for v1.1 fix.

### Q: What if user satisfaction is low but no bugs?
**A**: Defer launch. Low satisfaction means users won't adopt. Identify top 3 pain points from feedback, redesign, re-test.

### Q: What if accessibility fails?
**A**: Do NOT launch. Accessibility is not optional. Fix screen reader issues, re-test with accessibility users.

### Q: How do we handle duplicate bug reports?
**A**: Good sign (indicates high-impact issue). Mark as "Duplicate" in bug tracker, reference original bug ID, prioritize fix.

### Q: What if a participant can't complete all scenarios?
**A**: Okay! Even partial feedback is valuable. Ask them to prioritize Scenarios 1, 2, and 4 (onboarding, workout, analytics).
